# Develop Comprehensive Developer Documentation

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of comprehensive English-language developer documentation for the ava-aigc-toolbox project, following industry-standard formatting for large-scale projects.

## Phase 1: Branch Creation & Documentation Structure Setup

1. Create a dedicated branch `docs` for documentation development
2. Establish a well-structured documentation framework with industry-standard sections
3. Create a main documentation index with a hierarchical table of contents
4. Set up consistent formatting and styling guidelines for all documentation

## Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement

1. Add diagrams and visual aids where appropriate
2. Include code examples and tutorials
3. Add cross-references between documentation sections
4. Implement a search functionality if using a documentation framework
5. Ensure responsive design for different devices

## Phase 4: Review & Validation

1. Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Validate setup instructions by following them step-by-step
3. Ensure consistency across all documentation pages
4. Test navigation and table of contents functionality
5. Get feedback from other developers

## Phase 5: Merge & Publish

1. Merge the documentation branch into main
2. Update any links or references in the main project
3. Ensure documentation is accessible from the project's README
4. Set up automated documentation deployment if applicable

## Technical Documentation Stack

* Use Markdown for content creation (consistent with existing documentation)

* Consider using a documentation generator like MkDocs, Docusaurus, or Sphinx for better organization and search functionality

* Host documentation on GitHub Pages or similar platform

## Expected Outcomes

* Comprehensive, well-structured developer documentation following industry standards

* Clear table of contents for easy navigation

* Accurate and up-to-date information based on the project's technical stack

* Improved onboarding experience for new developers

* Better maintainability through documented architectural decisions

* Enhanced collaboration through clear contribution guidelines

This plan ensures that the documentation will be comprehensive, well-organized, and follow industry best practices for large-scale projects.
