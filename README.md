## FAQ

### How do I view my image's metadata (PNGInfo)?
With the Preview Pane visible, press `I` in the thumbnail view or when the Preview Pane is in focus to show or hide the metadata. You can also click the eye icon at the bottom right of the Preview Pane.

### What is Rebuild Metadata and when should I use it?
Rebuild Metadata rescans all your images and updates the database with any new or updated metadata. It doesn't affect your custom tags (rating, favorite, NSFW). Use this feature when a new version of BerryAIGen.Toolkit adds support for metadata formats that exist in your images.

### Can I move my images to a different folder?
To move images within your BerryAIGen folders while preserving metadata, use the **right-click > Move** command. This ensures all Toolkit-specific metadata (Favorites, Ratings, NSFW tags) remains intact. Using Explorer or other applications to move files will result in lost metadata.
